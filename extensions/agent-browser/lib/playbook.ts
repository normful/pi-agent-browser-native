/**
 * Purpose: Provide the canonical agent_browser operating playbook shared by runtime prompt metadata and generated documentation fragments.
 * Responsibilities: Define stable guidance bullets, native tool-call examples, and wrapper-behavior notes without importing runtime/browser process code.
 * Scope: Agent-facing documentation and prompt-guidance text only; command execution and wrapper state behavior live in runtime modules.
 * Usage: Imported by the extension entrypoint for promptGuidelines and by the documentation drift-check script for generated Markdown blocks.
 * Invariants/Assumptions: The native pi tool receives args after the agent-browser binary, stdin is only for batch/eval --stdin/auth save --password-stdin, and wrapper behavior documented here must match implemented behavior.
